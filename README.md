# Uploading Document to OpenText Content Server
Basic Upload Script for Uploading document to OpenText Content Server using the RESTful API

## Getting Setup
This project uses node/npm to build files, to set up:

    Install node
    run npm install
    update the index.html to point to the location of the js-cookie plugin
    Update the app.js file and update the sampleData JSON object

 To store and retrive the authorisation token I have used a brilliant little script : https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie
